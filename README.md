**Image classification web app using a deep learning model built in keras or tensorflow**
In this program we trained an deep learing modal in to process the image dataset to classifing the flower and we are using an function in the program to get input in the web app 

In this we used **Gradio** open source API form creating the webapp  


The gr.Interface is used to create a web-based interface for the predict_image function.


accuracy: 0.9874 of the deep learning modal of the epochs
